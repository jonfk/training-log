notes:
  - squats felt pretty great
  - depth on squats has been compromised for 2 weeks. need to fix it
  - took lots of rest time between sets of squats and bench
  - form on conventional deadlift was still bad but strength getting better
  - very fatigue towards the end of session and during accessories
