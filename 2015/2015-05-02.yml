notes:
  - squats were harder than expected
  - previous night, slept late and drank moderately
  - very dehydrated in the morning
  - nauseous during squats and bench press
  - lost concetration and fatigued during deadlifts
  - tried to concentrate on form on sumo deadlifts on 225 lbs
  - good advice from jason, keep back tight, spread knees and keep feet out
